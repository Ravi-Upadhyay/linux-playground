## Linux Distributions: 

1. Red hat family system (including CentOS and Fedora)
2. SUSE family system (including openSUSE)
3. Debian family system (including Ubuntu and Linux mint)

### RHCE

#### Some of the key facts about the Red Hat distribution family are:

- Fedora serves as an upstream testing platform for RHEL.
- CentOS is a close clone of RHEL, while Oracle Linux is mostly a copy with some changes (in fact, CentOS has been part of Red Hat since 2014).
- A heavily patched version 3.10 kernel is used in RHEL/CentOS 7, while version 4.18 is used in RHEL/CentOS 8.
- It supports hardware platforms such as Intel x86,  Arm, Itanium, PowerPC, and IBM System z.
- It uses the yum and dnf  RPM-based yum package managers (covered in detail later) to install, update, and remove packages in the system.
- RHEL is widely used by enterprises which host their own systems.

### SUSE

The relationship between SUSE  (SUSE Linux Enterprise Server (SLES) ) and openSUSE is similar to the one described between RHEL, CentOS, and Fedora.

We use openSUSE as the reference distribution for the SUSE family, as it is available to end users at no cost. Because the two products are extremely similar, the material that covers openSUSE can typically be applied to SLES with few problems.
